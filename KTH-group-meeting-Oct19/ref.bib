 abstract = {The analysis of censored failure times is considered. It is assumed that on each individual are available values of one or more explanatory variables. The hazard function (age-specific failure rate) is taken to be a function of the explanatory variables and unknown regression coefficients multiplied by an arbitrary and unknown function of time. A conditional likelihood is obtained, leading to inferences about the unknown regression coefficients. Some generalizations are outlined.},

 abstract = {For Gauss-Hermite quadrature, we consider a systematic method for transforming the variable of integration so that the integrand is sampled in an appropriate region. The effectiveness of the quadrature then depends on the ratio of the integrand to some Gaussian density being a smooth function, well approximated by a low-order polynomial. It is pointed out that, in this approach, order one Gauss-Hermite quadrature becomes the Laplace approximation. Thus the quadrature as implemented here can be thought of as a higher-order Laplace approximation.},

 abstract = {Nonlinear mixed-effects models have received a great deal of attention in the statistical literature in recent years because of the flexibility they offer in handling the unbalanced repeated-measures data that arise in different areas of investigation, such as pharmacokinetics and economics. Several different methods for estimating the parameters in nonlinear mixed-effects model have been proposed. We concentrate here on two of them--maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood. A rather complex numerical issue for (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation in nonlinear mixed-effects models is the evaluation of the log-likelihood function of the data, because it involves the evaluation of a multiple integral that, in most cases, does not have a closed-form expression. We consider here four different approximations to the log-likelihood, comparing their computational and statistical properties. We conclude that the linear mixed-effects (LME) approximation suggested by Lindstrom and Bates, the Laplacian approximation, and Gaussian quadrature centered at the conditional modes of the random effects are quite accurate and computationally efficient. Gaussian quadrature centered at the expected value of the random effects is quite inaccurate for a smaller number of abscissas and computationally inefficient for a larger number of abscissas. Importance sampling is accurate, but quite inefficient computationally.},

 abstract = {We present a flexible family of link-based regression models with time-independent (baseline) covariates. Particular choices of the link function yield a proportional hazard or a proportional odds model, among others. The background hazard function in the model is estimated using B-splines. This yields a full likelihood under both continuous time and random interval censoring. Residuals for influence and goodness-of-fit are described. Two examples are shown, one in continuous time and the other under interval censoring.},

abstract = {Abstract Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
