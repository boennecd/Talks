abstract = {Electronic health records are being increasingly used in medical research to answer more relevant and detailed clinical questions; however, they pose new and significant methodological challenges. For instance, observation times are likely correlated with the underlying disease severity: Patients with worse conditions utilise health care more and may have worse biomarker values recorded. Traditional methods for analysing longitudinal data assume independence between observation times and disease severity; yet, with health care data, such assumptions unlikely hold. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we compare different analytical approaches proposed to account for an informative visiting process to assess whether they lead to unbiased results. Furthermore, we formalise a joint model for the observation process and the longitudinal outcome within an extended joint modelling framework. We illustrate our results using data from a pragmatic trial on enhanced care for individuals with chronic kidney disease, and we introduce user-friendly software that can be used to fit the joint model for the observation process and a longitudinal outcome.},

Our method, variational boosting, iteratively refines an existing variational approximation by solving a sequence of optimization problems, allowing a trade-off between computation time and accuracy. We expand the variational approximating class by incorporating additional covariance structure and by introducing new components to form a mixture. We apply variational boosting to synthetic and real statistical models, and show that the resulting posterior inferences compare favorably to existing variational algorithms.}

 abstract = {Variational approximation methods have become a mainstay of contemporary machine learning methodology, but currently have little presence in statistics. We devise an effective variational approximation strategy for fitting generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) appropriate for grouped data. It involves Gaussian approximation to the distributions of random effects vectors, conditional on the responses. We show that Gaussian variational approximation is a relatively simple and natural alternative to Laplace approximation for fast, non-Monte Carlo, GLMM analysis. Numerical studies show Gaussian variational approximation to be very accurate in grouped data GLMM contexts. Finally, we point to some recent theory on consistency of Gaussian variational approximation in this context. Supplemental materials are available online.},
