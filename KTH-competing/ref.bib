    abstract = "{We propose to model the cause-specific cumulative incidence function of multivariate competing risks data using a random effects model that allows for within-cluster dependence of both risk and timing. The model contains parameters that makes it possible to assess how the two are connected, e.g. if high-risk is related to early onset. Under the proposed model, the cumulative incidences of all failure causes are modeled and all cause-specific and cross-cause associations specified. Consequently, left-truncation and right-censoring are easily dealt with. The proposed model is assessed using simulation studies and applied in analysis of Danish register-based family data on breast cancer.}",

 abstract = {A survey of recent developments in the theory and application of composite likelihood is provided, building on the review paper of Varin (2008). A range of application areas, including geostatistics, spatial extremes, and space-time models, as well as clustered and longitudinal data and time series are considered. The important area of applications to statistical genetics is omitted, in light of Larribe and Fearnhead (2011). Emphasis is given to the development of the theory, and the current state of knowledge on efficiency and robustness of composite likelihood inference.},
