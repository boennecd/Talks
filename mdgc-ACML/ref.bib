abstract = {Missing data imputation forms the first critical step of many data analysis pipelines. The challenge is greatest for mixed data sets, including real, Boolean, and ordinal data, where standard techniques for imputation fail basic sanity checks: for example, the imputed values may not follow the same distributions as the data. This paper proposes a new semiparametric algorithm to impute missing values, with no tuning parameters. The algorithm models mixed data as a Gaussian copula. This model can fit arbitrary marginals for continuous variables and can handle ordinal variables with many levels, including Boolean variables as a special case. We develop an efficient approximate EM algorithm to estimate copula parameters from incomplete mixed data. The resulting model reveals the statistical associations among variables. Experimental results on several synthetic and real datasets show the superiority of our proposed algorithm to state-of-the-art imputation algorithms for mixed data.},

We propose a flexible model called Latent Mixed Gaussian Copula Model that simultaneously deals with such mixed data by assuming that the observed ordinal variables are generated by latent variables. For parameter estimation, we introduce a convenient rank-based ensemble approach to estimate the latent correlation matrix, which can be subsequently applied to recover the latent graph structure. In addition, based on the ensemble estimator, we develop test statistics via a pseudo-likelihood approach to quantify the uncertainty associated with the low dimensional components of high-dimensional parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows the consistency of the estimator and asymptotic normality of the test statistic. Experiments on simulated and real gene expression data are conducted to validate our approach.}

Based on a suitable explicit parameterization of the unconditional or conditional transformation function, we establish a cascade of increasingly complex transformation models that can be estimated, compared and analysed in the maximum likelihood framework. Models for the unconditional or conditional distribution function of any univariate response variable can be set up and estimated in the same theoretical and computational framework simply by choosing an appropriate transformation function and parameterization thereof. The ability to evaluate the distribution function directly allows us to estimate models based on the exact likelihood, especially in the presence of random censoring or truncation. For discrete and continuous responses, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. A reference software implementation of maximum likelihood-based estimation for conditional transformation models that allows the same flexibility as the theory developed here was employed to illustrate the wide range of possible applications.},

We propose a minimax tilting method for exact independently and identically distributed data simulation from the truncated multivariate normal distribution. The new methodology provides both a method for simulation and an efficient estimator to hitherto intractable Gaussian integrals. We prove that the estimator has a rare vanishing relative error asymptotic property. Numerical experiments suggest that the scheme proposed is accurate in a wide range of set-ups for which competing estimation schemes fail. We give an application to exact independently and identically distributed data simulation from the Bayesian posterior of the probit regression model.},

The model assumes that the observed binary variables are obtained by dichotomizing latent variables that satisfy the Gaussian copula distribution. The goal is to infer the conditional independence relationship between the latent random variables, based on the observed mixed data. Our work has two main contributions: we propose a unified rank-based approach to estimate the correlation matrix of latent variables; we establish the concentration inequality of the proposed rank-based estimator. Consequently, our methods achieve the same rates of convergence for precision matrix estimation and graph recovery, as if the latent variables were observed. The methods proposed are numerically assessed through extensive simulation studies, and real data analysis.},

abstract = "For multivariate copula-based models for which maximum likelihood is computationally difficult, a two-stage estimation procedure has been proposed previously; the first stage involves maximum likelihood from univariate margins, and the second stage involves maximum likelihood of the dependence parameters with the univariate parameters held fixed from the first stage. Using the theory of inference functions, a partitioned matrix in a form amenable to analysis is obtained for the asymptotic covariance matrix of the two-stage estimator. The asymptotic relative efficiency of the two-stage estimation procedure compared with maximum likelihood estimation is studied. Analysis of the limiting cases of the independence copula and Fréchet upper bound help to determine common patterns in the efficiency as the dependence in the model increases. For the Fréchet upper bound, the two-stage estimation procedure can sometimes be equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation for the univariate parameters. Numerical results are shown for some models, including multivariate ordinal probit and bivariate extreme value distributions, to indicate the typical level of asymptotic efficiency for discrete and continuous data."

A leading case of such an integral is the negative orthant probability, where B = (V ¦V < 0). The problem is computationally difficult except in very special cases. The multinomial probit (MNP) model used in econometrics and biometrics has cell probabilities that are negative orthant probabilities, with μ and Ω depending on unknown parameters (and, in general, on covariates). Estimation of this model requires, for each trial parameter vector and each observation in a sample, evaluation of P(B; μ, Ω) and of its derivatives with respect to μ and Ω. This paper surveys Monte Carlo techniques that have been developed for approximations of P(B; μ, Ω) and its linear and logarithmic derivatives, that limit computation while possessing properties that facilitate their use in iterative calculations for statistical inference: the Crude Frequency Simulator (CFS), Normal Importance Sampling (NIS), a Kernel-Smoothed Frequency Simulator (KFS), Stern's Decomposition Simulator (SDS), the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane Simulator (GHK), a Parabolic Cylinder Function Simulator (PCF), Deák's Chi-squared Simulator (DCS), an Acceptance/Rejection Simulator (ARS), the Gibbs Sampler Simulator (GSS), a Sequentially Unbiased Simulator (SUS), and an Approximately Unbiased Simulator (AUS). We also discuss Gauss and FORTRAN implementations of these algorithms and present our computational experience with them. We find that GHK is overall the most reliable method."
