 abstract = {The analysis of censored failure times is considered. It is assumed that on each individual are available values of one or more explanatory variables. The hazard function (age-specific failure rate) is taken to be a function of the explanatory variables and unknown regression coefficients multiplied by an arbitrary and unknown function of time. A conditional likelihood is obtained, leading to inferences about the unknown regression coefficients. Some generalizations are outlined.},

 abstract = {For Gauss-Hermite quadrature, we consider a systematic method for transforming the variable of integration so that the integrand is sampled in an appropriate region. The effectiveness of the quadrature then depends on the ratio of the integrand to some Gaussian density being a smooth function, well approximated by a low-order polynomial. It is pointed out that, in this approach, order one Gauss-Hermite quadrature becomes the Laplace approximation. Thus the quadrature as implemented here can be thought of as a higher-order Laplace approximation.},

 abstract = {Nonlinear mixed-effects models have received a great deal of attention in the statistical literature in recent years because of the flexibility they offer in handling the unbalanced repeated-measures data that arise in different areas of investigation, such as pharmacokinetics and economics. Several different methods for estimating the parameters in nonlinear mixed-effects model have been proposed. We concentrate here on two of them--maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood. A rather complex numerical issue for (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation in nonlinear mixed-effects models is the evaluation of the log-likelihood function of the data, because it involves the evaluation of a multiple integral that, in most cases, does not have a closed-form expression. We consider here four different approximations to the log-likelihood, comparing their computational and statistical properties. We conclude that the linear mixed-effects (LME) approximation suggested by Lindstrom and Bates, the Laplacian approximation, and Gaussian quadrature centered at the conditional modes of the random effects are quite accurate and computationally efficient. Gaussian quadrature centered at the expected value of the random effects is quite inaccurate for a smaller number of abscissas and computationally inefficient for a larger number of abscissas. Importance sampling is accurate, but quite inefficient computationally.},

 abstract = {State space models are considered for observations which have non-Gaussian distributions. We obtain accurate approximations to the loglikelihood for such models by Monte Carlo simulation. Devices are introduced which improve the accuracy of the approximations and which increase computational efficiency. The loglikelihood function is maximised numerically to obtain estimates of the unknown hyperparameters. Standard errors of the estimates due to simulation are calculated. Details are given for the important special cases where the observations come from an exponential family distribution and where the observation equation is linear but the observation errors are non-Gaussian. The techniques are illustrated with a series for which the observations have a Poisson distribution and a series for which the observation have a t-distribution.},

abstract = {Abstract Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract="Two-filter smoothing is a principled approach for performing optimal smoothing in non-linear non-Gaussian state--space models where the smoothing distributions are computed through the combination of `forward' and `backward' time filters. The `forward' filter is the standard Bayesian filter but the `backward' filter, generally referred to as the backward information filter, is not a probability measure on the space of the hidden Markov process. In cases where the backward information filter can be computed in closed form, this technical point is not important. However, for general state--space models where there is no closed form expression, this prohibits the use of flexible numerical techniques such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to approximate the two-filter smoothing formula. We propose here a generalised two-filter smoothing formula which only requires approximating probability distributions and applies to any state--space model, removing the need to make restrictive assumptions used in previous approaches to this problem. SMC algorithms are developed to implement this generalised recursion and we illustrate their performance on various problems.",

 abstract = {In this paper we propose a new particle smoother that has a computational complexity of O(N), where N is the number of particles. This compares favourably with the O(N²) computational cost of most smoothers. The new method also overcomes some degeneracy problems in existing algorithms. Through simulation studies we show that substantial gains in efficiency are obtained for practical amounts of computational cost. It is shown both through these simulation studies, and by the analysis of an athletics dataset, that our new method also substantially outperforms the simple filter-smoother, the only other smoother with computational cost that is O(N).},

 abstract = {Particle methods are popular computational tools for Bayesian inference in nonlinear non-Gaussian state space models. For this class of models, we present two particle algorithms to compute the score vector and observed information matrix recursively. The first algorithm is implemented with computational complexity ð’ª(N) and the second with complexity ð’ª(NÂ²), where N is the number of particles. Although cheaper, the performance of the ð’ª(N) method degrades quickly, as it relies on the approximation of a sequence of probability distributions whose dimension increases linearly with time. In particular, even under strong mixing assumptions, the variance of the estimates computed with the ð’ª(N) method increases at least quadratically in time. The more expensive ð’ª(NÂ²) method relies on a nonstandard particle implementation and does not suffer from this rapid degradation. It is shown how both methods can be used to perform batch and recursive parameter estimation.},
