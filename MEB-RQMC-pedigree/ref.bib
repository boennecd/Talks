abstract = "Background
While genetic variation has a known impact on the risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), there is also evidence that there are maternal components to this risk. Here, we partitioned sources of variation, including direct genetic and maternal effects, on risk for OCD.
Methods
The study population consisted of 822,843 individuals from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, born in Sweden between January 1, 1982, and December 31, 1990, and followed for a diagnosis of OCD through December 31, 2013. Diagnostic information about OCD was obtained using the Swedish National Patient Register.
Results
A total of 7184 individuals in the birth cohort (0.87%) were diagnosed with OCD. After exploring various generalized linear mixed models to fit the diagnostic data, genetic maternal effects accounted for 7.6% (95% credible interval: 6.9%–8.3%) of the total variance in risk for OCD for the best model, and direct additive genetics accounted for 35% (95% credible interval: 32.3%–36.9%). These findings were robust under alternative models.
Conclusions
Our results establish genetic maternal effects as influencing risk for OCD in offspring. We also show that additive genetic effects in OCD are overestimated when maternal effects are not modeled."

abstract = {Abstract While the family-based analysis of genetic and environmental contributions to continuous or Gaussian traits is now straightforward using the linear mixed models approach, the corresponding analysis of complex binary traits is still rather limited. In the latter we usually rely on twin studies or pairs of relatives, but these studies often have limited sample size or have difficulties in dealing with the dependence between the pairs. Direct analysis of extended family data can potentially overcome these limitations. In this paper, we will describe various genetic models that can be analysed using an extended family structure. We use the generalized linear mixed model to deal with the family structure and likelihood-based methodology for parameter inference. The method is completely general, accommodating arbitrary family structures and incomplete data. We illustrate the methodology in great detail using the Swedish birth registry data on pre-eclampsia, a hypertensive condition induced by pregnancy. The statistical challenges include the specification of sensible models that contain a relatively large number of variance components compared to standard mixed models. In our illustration the models will account for maternal or foetal genetic effects, environmental effects, or a combination of these and we show how these effects can be readily estimated using family data.

abstract = "An extensive literature in econometrics and in numerical analysis has considered the problem of evaluating the multiple integral P(B; μ, Ω) = ∝ab n(v − μ, Ω)dv ≡ Ev1(V ϵ B), where V is a m-dimensional normal vector with mean μ, covariance matrix Ω, and density n(v − μ, Ω), and 1(V ϵ B) is an indicator for the event B = (V¦a < V < b). A leading case of such an integral is the negative orthant probability, where B = (V ¦V < 0). The problem is computationally difficult except in very special cases. The multinomial probit (MNP) model used in econometrics and biometrics has cell probabilities that are negative orthant probabilities, with μ and Ω depending on unknown parameters (and, in general, on covariates). Estimation of this model requires, for each trial parameter vector and each observation in a sample, evaluation of P(B; μ, Ω) and of its derivatives with respect to μ and Ω. This paper surveys Monte Carlo techniques that have been developed for approximations of P(B; μ, Ω) and its linear and logarithmic derivatives, that limit computation while possessing properties that facilitate their use in iterative calculations for statistical inference: the Crude Frequency Simulator (CFS), Normal Importance Sampling (NIS), a Kernel-Smoothed Frequency Simulator (KFS), Stern's Decomposition Simulator (SDS), the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane Simulator (GHK), a Parabolic Cylinder Function Simulator (PCF), Deák's Chi-squared Simulator (DCS), an Acceptance/Rejection Simulator (ARS), the Gibbs Sampler Simulator (GSS), a Sequentially Unbiased Simulator (SUS), and an Approximately Unbiased Simulator (AUS). We also discuss Gauss and FORTRAN implementations of these algorithms and present our computational experience with them. We find that GHK is overall the most reliable method."
